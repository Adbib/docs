# ðŸš€ Getting started

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! You've just taken your first step on the path to mastering Frontity.

Frontity is a **React-based framework** that enables you to easily build a frontend for a headless (or decoupled) WordPress site. Your WordPress site serves its data via the REST-API. Frontity framework is open source and free to use.

## Installation requirements

To get started with Frontity you will need:

* **A WordPress installation** - This can be hosted locally, on a web-server, or you can also use a site hosted on wordpress.com. However, when you spin up your first Frontity project you will initially be connected to our test site so you won't be without content when you first try Frontity.

* **Node installed in your computer** - If you don't already have it you can get **Node** from [the official site](https://nodejs.org/). This will also install **npm** and **npx** along with Node. You will use these to run Frontity commands during the set-up and development of your project.

To test if you have Node installed open your terminal and run:
~~~~
~ node -v
v10.15.3
~~~~
~~~~
~ npm -v
6.13.1
~~~~

> For those coming from WordPress it might be worth noting that **Frontity** runs on **Node**, so it needs to be deployed in a different server than your WordPress. If you want to learn more about this, visit our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/frontity/frontity#why-a-different-nodejs-server) or see the [Architecture](architecture/README.md) section of these docs.

Once you have a WordPress site and Node you're good to go and all set to get up and running....
