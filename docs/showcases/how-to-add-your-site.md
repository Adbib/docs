# How to add your site

If you have created a Frontity site, whether for a client or as a personal project, you can help us and the rest of the community by sharing it.

Sharing your project in our [**Showcases section**](https://community.frontity.org/c/showcases/19) means that others can learn, get inspired and see what can be accomplished with Frontity.

There are several different ways to add your Frontity site to the Showcase page:

1. Online form
2. Community forum
3. GitHub

## Online form

The easiest way is to fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe1yNVt-CP6zbGzfltIIu3Vj5eLFAjHpd_6qaZOuVpGUurh4g/viewform) with your site’s information:
- Title of your site (required)
- URL of your site (required)
- Source code (e.g. the GitHub repository of the project)
- Testimonial (a few lines about your experience with Frontity)
- Your email address (in case we need to contact you if there’s a problem with your form)
That’s it!
We will review your submission and feature your project in the Showcase page

## Community forum

In order to add it to the forum, simply go to the [Showcase category](https://community.frontity.org/c/showcases/19), open a new topic, and write a post with a link to your site.

Here are [some ideas](https://community.frontity.org/t/about-the-showcases-category/43) to include in your forum post.
All the sites shared in this category are featured in the Showcases page too.

## GitHub

If you prefer to use GitHub instead, go to the [Showcase page](https://docs.frontity.org/showcases) and click the “Edit on GitHub” link (on the right sidebar).
This will take you directly to the Showcases file in the repository.

Edit the `showcases.md` file and add your submission with the following format:

```
## Title of your Site

* Site: https://yourfrontitysite.com
* [Source code](https://github.com/user/github-repo)

> This can be a brief description of your site and/or your feedback about Frontity.
```

If there’s no open source code, feel free to remove that text line.
Once finished, click the “Propose file change” button and create a pull request.

We will review your pull request and merge it with the final version if everything is fine.
