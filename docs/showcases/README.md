# Showcases

Want to know what the community is building with frontity?
Here you have some examples

{% hint style="info" %}
Have you created a Frontity site? It could be for a client or just your personal site. 
Either way, share it in the [**Showcases** section](https://community.frontity.org/c/showcases/19) of our [Community Forum](https://community.frontity.org/) so others can learn, get inspired and see what can be accomplished with Frontity. 
Sometimes, an example is worth a thousand words. :slight_smile:

> I must admit I’m impressed with Frontity, I’ve hit hardly any errors, which for a brand new framework is quite an achievement.

> It’s kind of crazy how quickly I was able to do this knowing nothing about Frontity and not being super advanced with React. It was a 2.5 week dev timeline, and the mouse elements in particular were challenging to do, not due to Frontity but mostly due to lack of familiarity with doing advanced react stuff.

> Hi guys, I want to share with you all what I did with Frontity. Is not my best site, but I’m proud that I made it in one day. I think you can build almost everything with Frontity. So this is an example that shows the power of mixing Wordpress+React.

> My first frontity project (though plenty of Frankensteining different components from Mars and TwentyTwenty). Just wanted to share it here though it’s in a very early version - just super pumped to have a somewhat workable version: https://403page.com

> Using Frontity has been a pleasure. It’s really awesome how easily you can create a custom theme for Frontity, and integrate all the Wordpress data on it. And, as it’s a React app, the possibilities are unlimited, I’m already thinking to add some extra-features with business-logic to my blog, and using Wordpress as a headless CMS, and having an isolated React App to develop the frontend is the best scenario to achieve that.

> It’s essentially built off the mars-theme, with my own custom styling added and some of the structure rearranged. I’m still new to React and I’m primarily a designer (though I call myself a “design technologist” to hint at that), but I think there’s some nice stuff about it.
