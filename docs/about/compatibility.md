# Compatibility

The approach of Frontity is to prioritize modern browser performance and user experience, while keeping only moderate compatibility (the page loads and can be read) with old browsers (without Proxy support). 

| Platform                           | Support                 |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Node                               | 10+                     |
| Browsers without Proxy (like IE11) | No hydration (SSR only) |
| Browsers with Proxy                | Full hydration          |
