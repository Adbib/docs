# 🎤 Showcases

Want to see what the community is building with Frontity? Here are some great examples of Frontity in action!

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have created a Frontity site, whether for a client or as a personal project, you can help us and the rest of the community by sharing it. Sharing your project in our [**Showcases section**](https://community.frontity.org/c/showcases/19) means that others can learn, get inspired and see what can be accomplished with Frontity. An example is worth a thousand words. 🙂

> Using Frontity has been a pleasure. It’s really awesome how easily you can create a custom theme for Frontity, and integrate all the WordPress data on it. And, as it’s a React app, the possibilities are unlimited, I’m already thinking to add some extra-features with business-logic to my blog. Using WordPress as a headless CMS and having an isolated React App to develop the frontend is the best scenario to achieve that.

> It’s essentially built off the mars-theme, with my own custom styling added and some of the structure rearranged. I’m still new to React and I’m primarily a designer \(though I call myself a “design technologist” to hint at that\), but I think there’s some nice stuff about it.

> My first Frontity project \(though plenty of Frankensteining different components from Mars and TwentyTwenty\). Just wanted to share it here though it's in a very early version - just super pumped to have a somewhat workable version. [Read more](https://community.frontity.org/t/first-frontity-jobby/1102).

> It’s kind of crazy how quickly I was able to do this knowing nothing about Frontity and not being super advanced with React. It was a 2.5 week dev timeline, and the mouse elements in particular were challenging to do, not due to Frontity but mostly due to lack of familiarity with doing advanced React stuff.
