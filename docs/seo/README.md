# SEO

With Frontity you can optimize the SEO performance of your site and customize how your site is indexed by search engine crawlers . 

By default, Frontity will return fully populated HTML file generated from your React code.
This reduces the time required for the first contentful paint and ensures a good SEO score.

But that's not all.
With Frontity you can also customize:

- Meta tags 
- `robots.txt`

## Header meta tags

You can include the meta tags generated by your WordPress SEO plugin in your React app so they can be properly rendered in the final HTML

To do that you can use:

- The [REST API - Head Tags](../frontity-plugins/rest-api-head-tags) **WordPress plugin** developed by the Frontity team that will populate to the REST API the meta tags generated by your WordPress SEO plugin

- The [@frontity/head-tags](../api-reference-1/frontity-head-tags) **Frontity package** designed to get automatically all the data that the REST API Head Tags plugin exposes in the REST API

## `robots.txt`

A [`robots.txt`](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062608?hl=en&ref_topic=6061961&visit_id=637255580970870848-1263401344&rd=1) file tells search engine crawlers which pages or files the crawler can or can't request from your site.
