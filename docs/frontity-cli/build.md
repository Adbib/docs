# `build`

Builds the project for production.

```shell
npx frontity build [options]
```

The [`frontity serve`](serve.md) command will use the files generated by this `frontity build` command. 

## Arguments

### **`[options]`**

|            Option            | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| :--------------------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|       `-d`, `--development`       | Builds the project for development.                                                                          |
|        `--target <target>`         | Create bundles with "es5" or "module". Default target is "module".                                                                                      |
| `-h`, `--help`  | Output usage information                                                                                                             |

##### The `--development` option

This flag correspond to [webpack’s mode parameter](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/mode/) so it will run webpack in the development mode as described [there](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/mode/).

For example, when running react in development mode (when `process.env.NODE_ENV` is NOT set to `production`) you get [full error messages and warnings](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#use-the-production-build) from react if you use the development mode but at the cost of slower performance.

```
npx frontity build --development
```

Will build the Frontity project without any optimizations and with `process.env.NODE_ENV` set to `development`.
So, it’s basically the same as just running `frontity dev` except that it will only build the project `once` and will **not run the development server**.
