# build

Builds the project for production.

```text
npx frontity build [options]
```

The [`frontity serve`]() command will use the files generated by this `frontity build` command.

## Arguments

### **`[options]`**

| Option | Description |
| :---: | :--- |
| `-d`, `--development` | Builds the project for development. |
| `--target <target>` | Create bundles with "es5" or "module". Default target is "module". |
| `--publicPath <path>` | Set the [public path](https://webpack.js.org/guides/public-path/) for static assets. Default path is "/static/". |
| `-h`, `--help` | Output usage information |

#### The `--publicPath` option

By default Frontity will look for static assets in the path `<YOUR-DOMAIN>/static`

With the `--publicPath` option you can change the path from where you are serving the statics assets \(i.e. js chunk files, fonts, images, etc.\)

The [public path is included in the generated files by webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/public-path/) and cannot be changed after that. In case some people need to change it \(because of constrains in their site architecture\) they would need an option to do so just before generating the Frontity bundle with `npx frontity build`.

Example

```text
npx frontity build --publicPath="/other/folder"
```

## Examples

* Builds the project for productionusing an external domain `https://external-domain.com/static` as the path for statics

```text
npx frontity build --publicPath="https://external-domain.com/static"
```
