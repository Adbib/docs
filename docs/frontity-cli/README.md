# üíª Commands (Frontity CLI)


The Frontity command line tool (CLI) is the main entry point for getting up and running with a Frontity application and for using functionality including like running a development server and building out your Frontity application for deployment.

## How to use Frontity CLI

The Frontity CLI (Frontity commands) is available via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/frontity) and can be directly used by running `npx frontity <frontity-command>`

Run `npx frontity --help` for full help.


## API commands






### `info`

At the root of a Gatsby site, get helpful environment information which will be required when reporting a bug:

`gatsby info`

#### Options

|       Option        | Description                                             |
| :-----------------: | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-C`, `--clipboard` | Automagically copy environment information to clipboard |

### `clean`

At the root of a Gatsby site, wipe out the cache (`.cache` folder) and public directories:

`gatsby clean`

This is useful as a last resort when your local project seems to have issues or content does not seem to be refreshing. Issues this may fix commonly include:

- Stale data, e.g. this file/resource/etc. isn't appearing
- GraphQL error, e.g. this GraphQL resource should be present but is not
- Dependency issues, e.g. invalid version, cryptic errors in console, etc.
- Plugin issues, e.g. developing a local plugin and changes don't seem to be taking effect

### `plugin`

Run commands pertaining to gatsby plugins.

#### `docs`

`gatsby plugin docs`

Directs you to documentation about using and creating plugins.

### Repl

Get a Node.js REPL (interactive shell) with context of your Gatsby environment:

`gatsby repl`

Gatsby will prompt you to type in commands and explore. When it shows this: `gatsby >`

You can type in a command, such as one of these:

`babelrc`

`components`

`dataPaths`

`getNodes()`

`nodes`

`pages`

`schema`

`siteConfig`

`staticQueries`

When combined with the [GraphQL explorer](/docs/introducing-graphiql/), these REPL commands could be very helpful for understanding your Gatsby site's data.

For more information, check out the [Gatsby REPL documentation](/docs/gatsby-repl/).

### Disabling colored output

In addition to the explicit `--no-color` option, the CLI respects the presence of the `NO_COLOR` environment variable (see [no-color.org](https://no-color.org/)).

## How to change your default package manager for your next project?

When you use `gatsby new` for the first time to create a new project, you are asked to choose your default package manager between yarn and npm.

```shell
Which package manager would you like to use ? ‚Ä∫ - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
‚ùØ  yarn
   npm
```

Once you‚Äôve made your choice, the CLI won‚Äôt ask for your preference again for any subsequent project.

If you want to change this for your next project you have to edit the config file created automatically by the CLI.
This file is available on your system at: `~/.config/gatsby/config.json`

In it you‚Äôre going to see something like this.

```json:title=config.json
{
  "cli": {
    "packageManager": "yarn"
  }
}
```

Edit your `packageManager` value, save and you‚Äôre good to go for your next project using `gatsby new`.
