## Why will you need to adapt your configuration?

In order to use Frontity, a Node installation is required. This means that the WordPress default configuration won‚Äôt be enough, and you will need to adapt it to Frontity. But don‚Äôt worry, it will be very easy and will improve your web substantially üöÄ.

We are aware that this could be a burden, so Frontity is designed to make it as simple as possible:

1. Frontity works really well with serverless hostings like [Now](https://zeit.co/now), [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Google Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/) and so on, which makes it super cheap, really easy, and infinitely scalable.
2. We are working on different solutions to adapt to all user needs. You should check out all the possibilities we are thinking of, with their pros and cons, at [Possible installations](possible-architectures.md).

## Decisions you should take

As mentioned, in order to use Frontity, you will need to adapt your configuration a bit and there are some aspects you should consider before.

### Select Frontity installation

Frontity aims to match all user needs, and for this reason, we are working on different installation solutions, each one with pros and cons. You can check out all the possibilities in detail _\*\*_at the page [Possible installations](possible-architectures.md).

**üí° Recommendation:**

For most of the webs, we would recommend the solution "[**Direct to Frontity**](possible-architectures.md#direct-to-frontity)", as it has proven to be a great solution. You will need to configure a Node Server and a new domain, but it is really easy and it will improve your performance substantially.

### **Select your server hostings**

Depending on the installation solution you choose, you will need to have one or two servers. At the very least, you will need a PHP server to run your WordPress and, in most of the cases, you will also need a Node server to run Frontity.

**üí° Recommendation:**

1. PHP Server: In this case, we recommend to **continue using your actual server** for WordPress site or select your preferred hosting service such as [Siteground](https://www.siteground.com), [Raiola Networks](https://raiolanetworks.es/), [Webempresa](https://www.webempresa.com/) or any other.
2. Node Server: In case you need this one, we would recommend to choose a **serverless solution** as it will make it cheap, easy and infinitely scalable. We would select [Zeit Now](https://zeit.co/now) because it is really easy to set up and includes a CDN too, but there are other good options like [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Google Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/).

You can check out our documentation [how to deploy Frontity on Now](deploy-on-now.md).

{% endhint %}

### Select your domains

In some solutions, you will need to have two different domains, one for the WordPress dashboard, and the other one to show the content retrieved from the API. If you are using a solution that requires just one domain, you can keep your actual one, if not, you should create a subdomain.

**üí° Recommendation:**

1. Point your main domain **www.mydomain.com to Frontity,** as it will be the domain your users will visit.
2. **Create a new subdomain** for your admin dashboard, where you will access the UI to edit your content. Using a subdomain will prevent you from buying a new one. You could use, for example, **wp.mydomain.com**.

{% hint style="info" %}
In case you use WordPress.com, you can use **www.mydomain.wordpress.com** to manage your content and point Frontity to **www.mydomain.com**.
{% endhint %}

### Add a cache layer on top

If your hosting service doesn't provide cache, you may want to look for an additional solution \(it could be a CDN\), as it is key to improve your web performance.

Furthermore, according to our experience working with media publishers, we suggest you to look for a service offering [**stale-while-revalidate**](https://www.keycdn.com/blog/keycdn-supports-stale-while-revalidate), the best cache technique for this type of architecture.

**üí° Recommendation:**

We have tested many solutions for CDN and stale-while-revalidate, and we consider that the best options for this approach are [KeyCDN](https://www.keycdn.com) and [StackPath](https://www.stackpath.com/).

If you use Zeit Now, the serverless option we recommend, you won't have to worry about these as it offers both things: a CDN and the stale-while-revalidate technique \(or [Serverless Pre-Rendering](https://zeit.co/blog/serverless-pre-rendering) as they name it\). This way, you don't have to add anything else.

## Our recommended solution

If you have read the "Decisions you should take" section, you might already know what our recommendation is, as we have explained each part in detail. Although the recommendation may vary depending on each particular case and the solution may be different depending on the website, for the majority of sites we recommend:

1. Use the installation solution **Direct to Frontity**, where you will have your WordPress dashboard in a PHP server and Frontity in a Node Server.
2. **Keep the actual PHP server** you are using for WordPress for your backend \(or select a new one\), and [**deploy Frontity on Now**](deploy-on-now.md), a serverless, cheap, infinitely scalable and easy to set up solution.
3. Point your main domain www.myblog.com to Frontity and use a subdomain \(wp.myblog.com\) for WordPress.
4. If you have selected Now as your Node server solution, you won't need to worry about this, as it offers a CDN and the stale-while-revalidate technique \(or [Serverless Pre-Rendering](https://zeit.co/blog/serverless-pre-rendering) as they name it\). If you selected another solution, we would recommend you to use [KeyCDN](https://www.keycdn.com) or [StackPath](https://www.stackpath.com/) as additional services.

If you want more detail about each solution, you can check out the previous section [Decisions you should take](./#decisions-you-should-take)**.**
