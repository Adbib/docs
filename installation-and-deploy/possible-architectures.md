## Frontity possible installations

### Direct to Frontity

In this solution, WordPress is used as a headless CMS and we use Frontity to generate and show the final HTML. This means that WordPress is used just for managing the content.

* Frontity uses the WP API to retrieve content and generate the final HTML.
* Frontity is also capable to generate AMP pages with the same React code and CSS.

This solution requires a PHP Server for WordPress and a Node Server for Frontity, as well as a new domain for your WordPress site as the main one will be used by Frontity.

| **‚úÖ Pros** | ‚ùå **Cons** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Perfect fit for users with free WP.com blogs \(myblog.wordpress.com\). | Users need to change their WordPress domain. |
| Fastest server side rendering \(no useless WordPress request needed\). | A Frontity server is needed. |
|  | The server side rendering is still slow if the WordPress site is slow, so it may need a cache layer on top. |

### PHP Theme Bridge

{% hint style="warning" %}
üõ† This installation is still under construction. [Feel free to ask](https://community.frontity.org/c/framework) any questions you might have.
{% endhint %}

This is a PHP theme that doesn‚Äôt generate any HTML. Instead, it does an HTTP call to the Frontity server to retrieve the HTML and outputs that.

![](../.gitbook/assets/php-theme-bridge.png)

With this solution, you won't need a new domain for your WordPress site, but you will still need a PHP Server for WordPress and a Node Server for Frontity.

| ‚úÖ **Pros** | ‚ùå **Cons** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Users don‚Äôt need to change their WordPress domain. | A Frontity server is needed. |
| The cache can be done with WordPress plugins, which know when to invalidate it intelligently. | There is more routing involved \(it goes to WordPress, then Frontity, then WordPress outputs the HTML\). |
|  | Users **must** use a cache plugin or it will be very slow. |

### Static Rendered HTML

{% hint style="warning" %}
üõ† This installation is still under construction. [Feel free to ask](https://community.frontity.org/c/framework) any questions you might have.
{% endhint %}

Users create an HTML file for each possible route at building time. It's like Gatsby or Next.js.

| ‚úÖ **Pros** | ‚ùå **Cons** |
| :--- | :--- |
| No Frontity server is needed. | You need to generate a new build each time you publish or edit content. |
| No cache is needed. | A static HTML server is needed. |
| Server-side rendering is done at building time, so it is like ‚Äúinstant‚Äù. | Users need to move their WordPress site to a different domain. |
|  | Not recommended for big blogs with thousands of posts. |
|  | Not recommended for blogs that update content frequently. |

### React-only PHP theme

{% hint style="warning" %}
üõ† This installation is still under construction. [Feel free to ask](https://community.frontity.org/c/framework) any questions you might have.
{% endhint %}

This is a PHP theme generated by a Frontity command that renders an empty HTML which only contains the scripts to React. It‚Äôs basically a Single Page Application.

| ‚úÖ **Pros** | ‚ùå **Cons** |
| :--- | :--- |
| No Frontity server is needed. | It doesn‚Äôt have server side rendering. |
| Users don‚Äôt need to move their WordPress  site to a new domain. | No HTML: bad for SEO. |
| No cache is needed. | Bad for First meaningful paint of Lighthouse \(bad for SEO\). |
|  | Readers don‚Äôt see anything until React has finished loading: bad user experience. |
|  | The first React load is slower because it needs to do all the API calls. |

### Static HTML PHP Theme

{% hint style="warning" %}
üõ† This installation is still under construction. [Feel free to ask](https://community.frontity.org/c/framework) any questions you might have.
{% endhint %}

This is a PHP theme generated by a Frontity command but instead of rendering an empty HTML it includes an HTML file for each possible route.

| ‚úÖ **Pros** | ‚ùå **Cons** |
| :--- | :--- |
| No Frontity server is needed. | You need to generate a new build each time you publish or edit content. |
| Users don‚Äôt need to move their WordPress to a new domain. | Not recommended for big blogs with thousands of posts. |
| No cache is needed. | Not recommended for blogs that update content frequently. |
| A static HTML server is not needed. |  |
