# Keep Frontity Updated

As in most projects, keeping Frontity and its packages updated is always a good practice. Not only you could use new features added, but also some security issues are usually detected and solved during these updates.

At this point, it is important to distinguish between your **dependencies** \(npm packages you won't modify and reside in `/node_modules` folder\) and your **local packages** \(packages you create or change at your will, and reside in `/packages` folder\). For more info you can check the page [Learning Frontity - Packages](../learning-frontity/packages.md).

### Update project dependencies

Essential packages such as `frontity` ,  `@frontity/core`  or  `@frontity/tiny-router` ,  and all your dependencies, are included in this part. These can be treated as common npm packages, so you can use the following command to update your `package.json` to the latest versions:

```bash
npx npm-check-updates -u
npm install
```

With this, **you will update your package.json and all your dependencies in `node_modules`**, including the Frontity packages installed in **node\_modules**.

If you want to update just one package you can do it with this other command:

```bash
npm install my-package@latest
```

### Update local package dependencies

These local packages, included in `packages` folder, are supposed to be modified by the users, so any dependency won't be updated when you update your project dependencies.

To update the dependencies of your local package dependencies, go to their folder and run the same command:

```bash
cd package/my-local-package
npx npm-check-updates -u
# DO NOT RUN "npm install" this time!
```

Do that for each local package found in your `/packages` folder.

After you've finished, go to the root folder of your Frontity project and run `npm install` there:

```bash
cd ../.. # Go back to the root folder
npm install
```

Make sure there doesn't exist any `node_modules` folder inside `/packages`. It should be only one`node_modules`, in your root folder.

If you find additional node\_modules folders inside your `/packages`, delete them, delete the `package-lock.json` file and do an `npm install` from the root folder again.
